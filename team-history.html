          <p>
            The Beijing Academy VEX Robotics program began during the High Stakes season.
            At its very beginning, the team consisted of only Benjamin Jiang and a single
            competition team, 6353A. With no established system in place, many aspects of
            training, organization, and competition were explored for the first time.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the in-class VEX elective was introduced in its first year, participation
            expanded rapidly to around thirty students. This marked a turning point for
            the program, allowing structured training to coexist with competitive
            preparation. Over time, the team grew to include additional competition teams,
            such as 6353B and the middle school team 20139A.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout this period of growth, team members developed strong bonds through
            extensive training and shared competition experiences. Collaboration and
            mutual trust became defining characteristics of the team culture, contributing
            to consistent performance and a series of competitive achievements across events.
          </p>

          <p>
            Entering the second year, the program faced a new beginning. As many founding
            members graduated, team composition evolved once again. Despite these changes,
            the Beijing Academy VEX Robotics Team continues to adapt, carrying forward
            experience and standards established in earlier seasons, with the goal of
            achieving even stronger results in the future.
