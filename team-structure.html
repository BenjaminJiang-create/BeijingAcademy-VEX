              Our structure is designed to be sustainable across years. The in-class elective builds a stable training
              pipeline, while the competition team turns that foundation into a working system under real constraints.
            </p>

            <p>
              This separation keeps the program inclusive for new students while maintaining a high ceiling for team
              members preparing for V5RC. The result is continuity: skills are taught, applied, documented, and passed on.

        <p class="ts-section-intro">
          The elective is divided into two classes based on experience and objectives. Both classes follow the same engineering
          expectations, but target different stages of development.

              Class A is an advanced section designed to strengthen competition members. Work is aligned with V5RC preparation,
              including autonomous development, driver practice, and match-oriented iteration.
            </p>
            <p class="ts-card-text">
              The objective is shared readiness: consistent workflows, shared terminology, and repeatable execution outside of class.

              Class B is for students who are new to VEX. The focus is on fundamentals: basic mechanical construction,
              introductory programming ideas, and developing interest in engineering through guided practice.
            </p>
            <p class="ts-card-text">
              After building a foundation, students may choose whether to join the competition team based on interest,
