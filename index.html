      <h2>Who We Are</h2>

      <p>
        Beijing Academy VEX Robotics is an engineering community based at the
        Beijing Academy International Devision. The program was initiated in
        2023 by Benjamin Jiang with the intention of building a sustainable,
        team-driven robotics culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        We focus on long-term iteration and collaboration across mechanical design,
        programming, and match strategy. Beyond competition preparation, the team
        operates an internal training pipeline and supports an on-campus VEX elective
        to ensure knowledge transfer and continuity.
      </p>

    <h2>How We Work</h2>

    <p>
      The team operates through a hybrid structure that combines an in-class
      VEX robotics elective with extracurricular competition teams. This model
      allows students to engage with engineering both as a structured academic
      subject and as a long-term collaborative practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the academic term, the elective course focuses on foundational skills
      including mechanical design principles, programming logic, and system-level
      thinking. Students work through guided builds and controlled iterations,
      forming a shared technical baseline across the team.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of class, competition teams extend this foundation into real systems.
      Designs are refined under time constraints, code is stress-tested in match
      conditions, and decisions are made collaboratively during continuous iteration.
      Knowledge developed through competition is brought back into the course, closing
      the loop between learning and practice.
