      <p>VEX Robotics is a global, game-based robotics program that connects students with real engineering and teamwork.</p>

        <strong>VEX Robotics</strong> provides a series of hands-on robotics programs where students design,
        build, and program robots to play a new game every season. From the first sketch to the final match,
        teams experience the full engineering design process: brainstorming, prototyping, testing, and iteration.
      </p>
      <p>
        VEX is not only a competition; it is a platform that encourages creativity, resilience, and leadership.
        Students learn to treat every failure as data, and every match as feedback for the next improvement.

        VEX is one of the most widely adopted school-based robotics programs in the world. Here are some approximate figures
        that show its scale and impact.

    <!-- Why VEX at Beijing Academy -->
    <section class="card why-vex">
      <h2>Why VEX at Beijing Academy?</h2>
      <p>
        At Beijing Academy, we want robotics to be more than a competition team—we want it to be a learning environment where
        students can connect classroom theory with real-world engineering practice.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Project-based learning:</strong> VEX gives students a concrete project that integrates physics, math,
          computer science, and design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Student leadership:</strong> Teams are student-run. Members take responsibility for planning, documenting,
          communicating, and making technical decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inclusive opportunities:</strong> VEX offers roles for builders, programmers, drivers, notebook writers,
          media creators, and strategists—students with different strengths can all contribute.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pathways to competitions and outreach:</strong> Through local and regional events, students gain experience
          presenting their work, collaborating with other schools, and representing Beijing Academy in the wider STEM community.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By building a strong VEX program, we hope to create a long-term platform where students can grow from beginners to
        mentors, and where each season’s experience is passed on to the next generation of builders and innovators.
