            <strong>VEX Robotics</strong> provides a series of hands-on robotics programs where students design,
            build, and program robots to play a new game every season. From the first sketch to the final match,
            teams experience the full engineering design process: brainstorming, prototyping, testing, and iteration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each season presents a different challenge—scoring game objects, navigating complex fields, and working
            with alliance partners. Through this process, students develop practical skills in mechanical design,
            coding, strategy, and project management, while learning how to communicate and solve problems as a team.
          </p>
          <p>
            VEX is not only a competition; it is a platform that encourages creativity, resilience, and leadership.
            Students learn to treat every failure as data, and every match as feedback for the next improvement.

    <!-- Why VEX at Beijing Academy? 白底色块 -->
    <section class="vex-band vex-band-light">
      <div class="vex-inner">
        <h2>Why VEX at Beijing Academy?</h2>
        <p>
          At Beijing Academy, we want robotics to be more than a competition team—we want it to be a learning environment
          where students can connect classroom theory with real-world engineering practice.
        </p>
        <ul class="vex-why-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Project-based learning:</strong> VEX gives students a concrete project that integrates physics,
            math, computer science, and design.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Student leadership:</strong> Teams are student-run. Members take responsibility for planning,
            documenting, communicating, and making technical decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inclusive roles:</strong> Builders, programmers, drivers, notebook writers, media creators,
            and strategists all have important roles on the team.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Connection to the world:</strong> Through local and regional events, students present their work,
            collaborate with other schools, and represent Beijing Academy in the wider STEM community.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By building a strong VEX program, we hope to create a long-term platform where students can grow from beginners
          to mentors, and pass their experience on to the next generation of builders and innovators.
